/**
 * ------ Context ------
 *
 * The library provides a built-in static constant kernel context. This context
 * offers only limited functionality. It detects and self-checks the correct
 * sha256 implementation, initializes the random number generator and
 * self-checks the secp256k1 static context. It is used internally for otherwise
 * "context-free" operations.
 *
 * The user can create their own context for passing it to state-rich validation
 * functions and holding callbacks for kernel events.
 *
 * ------ Error handling ------
 *
 * When passing the kernel_Error argument to a function it may either be null or
 * initialized to an initial value. It is recommended to set kernel_ERROR_OK
 * before passing it to a function.
 *
 * The kernel notifications issue callbacks for errors. These are usually
 * indicative of a system error. If such an error is issued, it is recommended
 * to halt and tear down the existing kernel objects. Remediating the error may
 * require system intervention by the user.
 *
 * ------ Pointer and argument conventions ------
 *
 * The user is responsible for de-allocating the memory owned by pointers
 * returned by functions. Typically pointers returned by *_create(...) functions
 * can be de-allocated by corresponding *_destroy(...) functions.
 *
 * Pointer arguments make no assumptions on their lifetime. Once the function
 * returns the user can safely de-allocate the passed in arguments.
 *
 * Pointers passed by callbacks are not owned by the user and are only valid for
 * the duration of it. They should not be de-allocated by the user.
 *
 * Array lengths follow the pointer argument they describe.
